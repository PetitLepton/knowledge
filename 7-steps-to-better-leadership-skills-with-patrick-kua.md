- Effective managers remove blockers and provide the tools their teams need to accomplish what they do best;
- “They need a plan to stay up on what their team is doing, and also offer ways to help grow people so that they can get to a point where they can delegate those activities. It’s like the old saying—show one, do one, teach one.”
- bring continuous feedback;
- in principle, everyone should bring feedback to eachother at some point. But how do you do that when each member works on different subjects?
- “If somebody is doing an activity or task for the first time, and you let them go for months without any sort of help, that creates a problem. So I approach it more like this: You have to show them how to do it. You shadow them. Then you get them to do it. You give them feedback. And when they’re ready, you ask them to teach it to someone else so they get a deeper understanding about the concepts.”
