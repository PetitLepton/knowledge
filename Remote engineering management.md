# Meetings
- schedule the meetings to avoid distractions, _i.e._ middle of the morning or the afternoon
- as a manager, your role is to be disrupted
> Tip: schedule the meeting to stop 5 to 10 minutes before the time you think is necessary
> Tip: ask once per month if a regular meeting is still useful

### Retrospective
- use start/stop/keep or good/bad/ugly with stickers
1. asynchronous: prepare a virtual board (_e.g._ Miro)
2. asynchronous: share the board in advance (maybe a few days before) for people to start asynchronous: putting ideas and other to comment on them
3. asynchronous: vote on the different items about their importance
4. synchronous: discussion about the items and taking decisions
5. synchronous: do a recap on the right medium (Slack for example)
6. for the manager: ensure that people follow-up if actions are to be done
7. ask about the meeting in order to improve it and share the feedback anonymously afterwards to know what other members think
> Always include a time-keeper/moderator and a note taker.
> If actions need to be taken, always include who is going to perform the action

### Team building
- always run activities during working hours
	- avoid people feel pressured to attend despite having other activities
	- allow people to properly split work/personal time
	- avoid putting people who prefer not to paticipate not to feel "as not team players" 
- types of activities:
	- games: choose the game based on the latest activities of the team (intensive or tedious)
	- escape rooms
	- live creative experiences, _e.g_ cooking, painting
	- watch & learn on something far from engineering
### Team stand-ups/check-ins
- not really about the updates but more about the social exchanges

# One-on-ones
- dedicated time to receive feedback, be coached, work through issues together and talk about anything that can't be talked about in a group
- check the progress of goals every six weeks or so
	- agenda and content should be shared in advance
- Example of content structure
> Talking points
> 	Any subjects goes there
> What's something you did in the last two weeks that I probably don't know about?
> 	This is a place where thay can brag about their achievements
> Anything I could have helped with or done better in the last two weeks?
> Other on the spot topics

- from the description of the exchanges between managers, it seems that many of the tasks are blurred in terms of ownership between the manager and the project manager, _e.g._ "How could we collaborate better?" or "What important topics are coming up in the business that we should start talking about?" (see p. 94)
